# Project Charter: Nimify Anything

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Nimify Anything  
**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Project Type**: Open Source CLI Tool  
**Repository**: https://github.com/danieleschmidt/nimify-anything  

## Mission Statement

Democratize AI model deployment by providing a single command that transforms any ONNX or TensorRT model into a production-ready, scalable NVIDIA NIM microservice with comprehensive monitoring and enterprise-grade reliability.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Complex Deployment Process**: Deploying AI models to production requires deep knowledge of containers, Kubernetes, monitoring, and GPU optimization
2. **Inconsistent Standards**: Each team builds custom solutions leading to fragmented approaches
3. **Time to Production**: Weeks or months from model training to production deployment
4. **Operational Overhead**: Manual configuration of scaling, monitoring, and reliability features
5. **GPU Efficiency**: Suboptimal GPU utilization due to poor batching and scheduling

### Target Impact
- **Reduce deployment time from weeks to minutes**
- **Eliminate infrastructure expertise requirements for ML teams**
- **Standardize AI service deployment across organizations**
- **Maximize GPU utilization and cost efficiency**

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Deployment Simplicity**: Single command deployment from model file to production API
2. **Performance**: <100ms P95 latency for standard inference workloads
3. **Scalability**: Auto-scaling from 0 to 1000+ concurrent requests
4. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with zero-downtime deployments
5. **Observability**: Complete monitoring and alerting out of the box
