  }
}'

# Service outage - enable maintenance mode
kubectl patch configmap app-config -p '{
  "data": {
    "maintenance_mode": "true"
  }
}'
```

#### Short-term Containment (Stop the Bleeding)
```bash
# Scale up services to handle load
kubectl scale deployment nimify-service --replicas=10

# Rollback recent deployments if suspected cause
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nimify-service

# Enable rate limiting
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: nimify-circuit-breaker
spec:
  host: nimify-service
  trafficPolicy:
    connectionPool:
      tcp:
        maxConnections: 100
      http:
        http1MaxPendingRequests: 50
        maxRequestsPerConnection: 10
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 3
EOF
```

#### Long-term Containment (Sustainable Fix)
```bash
# Implement proper fix
helm upgrade nimify ./helm/nimify --set image.tag=hotfix-v1.2.4

# Update security policies
kubectl apply -f security/updated-policies.yaml

# Patch vulnerabilities
