# ADR-0001: Use NVIDIA NIM Runtime as Backend

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project aims to simplify deployment of AI models for inference. We need to choose a runtime that provides:
- High performance GPU acceleration
- Production-ready serving capabilities
- Industry-standard APIs
- Robust monitoring and scaling

## Decision
We will use NVIDIA NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) runtime as the primary backend for model serving, built on top of Triton Inference Server.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs with TensorRT acceleration
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows OpenAPI standards for inference APIs
- **Production Ready**: Built-in batching, caching, and load balancing
- **Ecosystem**: Integrates with Kubernetes, Prometheus, and cloud platforms
- **Enterprise Support**: Backed by NVIDIA with commercial support options

### Negative
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tight coupling with NVIDIA ecosystem
- **GPU Dependency**: Requires NVIDIA GPUs for optimal performance
- **Complexity**: Additional layer of abstraction over raw model serving
- **Licensing**: Commercial deployment may require NVIDIA licensing

## Alternatives Considered

1. **TorchServe**: Good PyTorch integration but limited multi-framework support
2. **TensorFlow Serving**: Excellent for TensorFlow models but not framework-agnostic
3. **ONNX Runtime**: Lightweight but lacks enterprise features
4. **Raw Triton**: More flexible but requires significant configuration

## Implementation Notes
- Target NIM 2.0+ for latest features
- Maintain compatibility with Triton config format
- Provide fallback to standard Triton for non-NIM environments
