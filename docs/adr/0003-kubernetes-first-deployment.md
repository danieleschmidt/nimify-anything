# ADR-0003: Kubernetes-First Deployment Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Modern AI/ML deployments require scalability, reliability, and observability. We need to choose primary deployment targets and strategies.

## Decision
We will prioritize Kubernetes as the primary deployment target, providing Helm charts and kubectl integration, while supporting Docker Compose for development.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: HPA and VPA for automatic scaling
- **Reliability**: Self-healing, rolling updates, health checks
- **Observability**: Native integration with Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
- **Industry Standard**: Most enterprises use Kubernetes for ML workloads
- **GPU Management**: Excellent GPU scheduling and resource management

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Steeper learning curve for developers
- **Resource Overhead**: Kubernetes cluster required for deployment
- **Configuration**: More YAML and configuration to maintain

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Docker Compose**: Simpler but limited scalability
2. **Cloud Functions**: Good for lightweight inference but GPU limitations
3. **Bare Metal**: Maximum performance but operational complexity
4. **Multiple Targets**: Support everything (too much maintenance burden)

## Implementation Notes
- Generate Helm charts with best practices
- Support multiple Kubernetes distributions (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.)
- Provide development setup with kind/minikube
- Include GPU node affinity and tolerations
- Support both CPU and GPU deployments
