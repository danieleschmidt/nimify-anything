# Architecture Overview

## System Design

Nimify Anything follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility and ease of use.

## Core Components

### 1. CLI Interface (`cli.py`)
- Entry point for all user interactions
- Built with Click for robust command-line parsing
- Provides subcommands for create, build, deploy operations

### 2. Core Engine (`core.py`)
- `ModelConfig`: Configuration management for NIM services
- `Nimifier`: Main orchestration class
- `NIMService`: Represents a configured service instance

### 3. Model Processing Pipeline
```
Model File → Analysis → Config Generation → Container Build → Deployment
```

## Data Flow

1. **Input**: User provides model file (ONNX/TensorRT) and configuration
2. **Analysis**: System inspects model structure and requirements
3. **Generation**: Creates deployment artifacts (OpenAPI, Helm charts, Dockerfile)
4. **Build**: Constructs optimized container image
5. **Deploy**: Launches service in target environment

## Integration Points

### NVIDIA NIM Runtime
- Leverages Triton Inference Server as the backend
- Integrates with NVIDIA's optimization libraries
- Supports GPU acceleration and batching

### Kubernetes
- Generates Helm charts for production deployment
- Configures autoscaling based on GPU utilization
- Includes monitoring and observability

### Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Custom NIM-specific metrics

## Extensibility

The architecture supports:
- Custom preprocessors and postprocessors
- Additional model formats
- Multiple deployment targets
- Custom metric collectors

## Security Considerations

- Model validation and scanning
- Secure container builds
- RBAC for Kubernetes deployments
- Secrets management integration
